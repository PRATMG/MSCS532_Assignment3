# Assignment3: Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining

## This project implements and analyzes the performance of Randomized Quicksort and a Hash Table with Chaining. Both algorithms are compared based on theoretical analysis and empirical testing.

## Required Libraries
- python 3.x
- numpy (for empirical comparisons) (to install using pip run: "pip install numpy")

## How to Run the Code
- To run the **Randomized Quicksort**, execute the following in the terminal:
python3 main.py

- To run the **Hash Table with Chaining**, execute the following in the terminal:
python3 hash_table_chaining.py
